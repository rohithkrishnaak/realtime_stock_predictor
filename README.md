# Real-Time Indian Equity Predictor & Backtester 🇮🇳 📈

A machine learning project designed to predict daily price movements (Up/Down) for Indian stocks using historical market data and technical analysis. This repository compares a baseline Random Forest model against a more advanced XGBoost implementation.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

**PLEASE READ BEFORE USING:**

This project is for **educational and research purposes only**.
* **Not Financial Advice:** The predictions and "Buy/Sell" signals generated by this software are based on mathematical patterns in historical data. They do not guarantee future results.
* **Risk Warning:** Trading in financial markets (stocks, options, ETFs) involves a high degree of risk and can result in the loss of your entire investment.
* **No Liability:** The author of this code is not a SEBI-registered investment advisor. You are solely responsible for your own investment decisions. Do not trade real money based solely on these models.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Real-Time Data Fetching:** Automatically downloads 5 years of historical data using the `yfinance` API.
* **Indian Market Focused:** Pre-configured for NSE stocks like **Tata Motors** (`TATAMOTORS.NS`) and **Adani Power** (`ADANIPOWER.NS`).
* **Technical Indicators:** Uses financial engineering to create model features:
    * **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** To identify overbought/oversold zones.
    * **SMA (Simple Moving Average):** Tracks 20-day and 50-day trends.
    * **Volatility:** Rolling standard deviation to measure risk.
* **Backtesting Engine:** Simulates a trading strategy based on high-confidence predictions (>60% probability) and plots the performance against a standard "Buy and Hold" strategy.

## 📂 Project Structure

| File | Description | Algorithm |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `model1.py` | Baseline linear script for initial testing. | **Random Forest Classifier** |
| `model2.py` | Advanced, modular script with cleaner architecture. | **XGBoost Classifier** |
| `requirements.txt` | List of Python dependencies. | N/A |

## 🛠️ Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/stock-predictor.git](https://github.com/yourusername/stock-predictor.git)
    cd stock-predictor
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## 💻 How to Run

It is recommended to run the advanced model (`model2.py`) for better performance and code structure.

1.  Run the script:
    ```bash
    python model2.py
    ```
2.  Select a stock when prompted:
    ```text
    1. Tata Motors
    2. Adani Power
    Enter: 1
    ```

## 📊 Results

The model outputs two key metrics:
1.  **Precision Score:** The percentage of time the model was correct when it predicted the price would go UP.
2.  **Next Day Probability:** The confidence level (0.0 to 1.0) that the stock will close higher tomorrow.

It also generates a performance plot:
* **Grey Line:** Returns if you bought and held the stock.
* **Green Line:** Returns if you traded using the ML strategy.
